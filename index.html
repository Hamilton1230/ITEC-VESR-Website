        <h2>Open-Mindedness</h2>
        <p>
        <li>I believe in staying open-minded towards any individual no matter how they see themselves or what they're interests are.</li>
        <li>I've realized that you need to fully accept someone for who they are to be able to form deep relationships with them, and understanding that everyone is into different things, so there's no need to make fun of someone's interests.</li>
        <li>It's important to be open-minded because it allows people to connect with others easily and create a sense of belonging.</li>
        <li>If people aren't open-minded towards others, it ends up creating a divide that could lead to feelings of hatred.</li>
          </p>
    </div>
        <h2>Compassion</h2>
        <p>
        <li>I constantly try to treat anybody with kindness, as to me there's already too much hate in the world.</li>
        <li>Compassion is a very important value for me to have because I want to show others that I am here for them when they are struggling with anything, mentally or physically. I am always willing to help.</li>
        <li>It's important to have compassion because it can improve others mental and physical health, by just showing an act of kindness towards them.</li>
        <ii>If you can't seem to care for others, you can struggle to form deep relationships with people, which are essential to have today.</li>
          </p>
    </div>
        <h2>Respect</h2>
        <p>
        <li>I strive to treat others the way I would want to be treated.</li>
        <li>I've always lived by the golden rule ever since it was taught to me, and it's allowed me to experience just how imortant respect is.</li>
        <li>By respecting others, it's easy to be respected back, which allows relationships to last longer and form even deeper bonds.</li>
        <li>If you're not respecting others, people may not want to form any kind of connection with you, and you could also be treated without respect.</li>
        </p>
    </div>
        <h2>Responsibilty</h2>
        <p>
        <li>I hold myself accountable for all my actions, whether they are good or bad.</li>
        <li>Keeping myself accountable for my actions allows me to fully understand what I've done, and its consequences that came along with that action, which also helps me make future decisions.</li>
        <li>It's important to be responsible because it will let others know that you can be trusted and can depend on you.</li>
        <li>If you can't hold yourself accountable for your actions, others may not be able to trust you because you couldn't even understand what you possibly did wrong.</li>
